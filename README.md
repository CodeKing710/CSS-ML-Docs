# PLACSS
The PlasterLang overhaul for HTML/CSS UI design layout, uses tags instead of classes for predefined layout schemas and can all be run client side! Includes support for a modified Plasterlang implementation more suited for JavaScript (currently unfinished)

Only thing you need to include from this repo is the placss.css, dependency_factory.js and placss.js files
